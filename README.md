# Efficient README Generator
This week's challenge was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package
## Installation
Only installation needed is to use at the command line is:
npm i inquirer@8.2.4

Then invoke the program by using the following command:
node index.js
## Usage
To use this program, it must be used in the command line. Once the programs has been invoked, then follow the prompts and input your choices. A readme will be generated after the program has finished running.

## Credits
Big thanks to the instructor, staff, BCs Learning Assistant and tutor. 
## Licenses
Please refer to the LICENSE in the repo.
